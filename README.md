# book-recommender-system
Abstract:
    There are millions of books in the enï¿½re world wide and people
need some instructions to find the appropriate book. Making decision and
scrolling for the right book from millions of books can be hard and a complete
waste of time. To compete and keep up in the market, some viewers may just
rate the book in unbiased form. In this project, we use python to build a web
application which consists of top books and recommend page where the user
input the book name and using machine learning model it will predict 4 books
related to the book name entered. This helps customer to read similar type
of book he likes.

 Here we use machine learning model to suggest similar books to the user. Using
Popularity based and Collaborative based filtering system to show top 50
books all over the world and also it recommends 4 books to the user based
on ratings and votes. Here we consider data of the people who have read and
rated more than 200 books by which we can increase the accuracy of the
project.

This project Developed using Pycharm and jupyter notebook. This project has been
